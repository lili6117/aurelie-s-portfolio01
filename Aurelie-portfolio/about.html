<h2>Ux Designer</h2>
<strong>About Me</strong>
<p>I'm a Ux Designer, originally from France. <br>
    I'm motivated by having an impact in everything I do. <br>
    I always pay attention to detail, I like learning new <a href="#design-skills" title="go to design skills"> design skills</a> and read books. <br>
In addition to design, I enjoy traveling and discovering new cultures. <br>
 I strive to make a positive impact on the world around me. <br>
 Whether it's tackling complex problems or collaborating with others, I thrive on the challenge of pushing boundaries and achieving excellence. <br>
 As I navigate the journey of life, I am always open to new opportunities, experiences, and connections. <br>
 Hobbies provide a space for personal expression, self-discovery, and the development of new skills. <br>
 They also offer opportunities for social interaction, as many hobbies can be enjoyed in groups or shared with like-minded individuals. <br>
 Whatever the choice, the essence of a hobby lies in the joy and fulfillment it brings to one's life. <br>
 So, let's embark on this journey together and discover the endless possibilities that await! <br>
